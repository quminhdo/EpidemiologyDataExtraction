Macleod	2016	Characterizing the Morbidity of Postchemotherapy Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection for Testis Cancer in a National Cohort of Privately Insured Patients	To characterize morbidity of postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) for testis cancer, we analyze a contemporary national database. PCRPLND is the standard for residual radiographic masses ?1 cm (nonseminoma) and positron emission tomographyavid masses ?3 cm (seminoma). Morbidity for PC-RPLND is greater than primary RPLND, which may be mitigated by performing surgery at a high-volume cancer center.

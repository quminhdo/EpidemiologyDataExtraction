Identifying the prevalence and prevalence ratios\\nof these conditions will inform clinical treatment. This nested, case-controlled study used International Classiﬁ-\\ncation of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes from the MarketScan® insurance claims databases from 2006 to\\n2012 and healthcare claims data for US-based employer and government-sponsored health plans. Prevalence and\\nprevalence ratio calculations of neuropsychiatric comorbidities for adults (≥20 years old) with PKU were com-\\npared with two groups [diabetes mellitus (DM) and general population (GP)] matched by age, gender, geograph-\\nic location, and insurance type. Age cohorts (i.e., 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, and 70 + years, and a\\ncombined subset of 20–39) were used to stratify data. The PKU cohort experienced signiﬁcantly higher rates of\\nseveral comorbid neurologic, psychiatric and developmental conditions. Compared to GP, PKU was associated\\nwith signiﬁcantly higher prevalence for numerous neuropsychiatric conditions, most notably for intellectual dis-\\nability (PR = 7.9, 95% CI: 6.4–9.9), autism spectrum disorder (PR = 6.1, 95% CI: 3.6–10.4), Tourette/tic disorders\\n(PR = 5.4, 95% CI: 2.1–14.1), and eating disorders (4.0, 95% CI: 3.2–5.0). Rates of fatigue/malaise, epilepsy/con-\\nvulsions, sleep disturbance, personality disorders, phobias, psychosis, and migraines among those with PKU\\nexceeded rates for the GP but were comparable to those with DM, with signiﬁcantly lower rates of concomitant\\ndisorders occurring in younger, compared to older, adults with PKU. Lifelong monitoring and treatment of co-oc-\\ncurring neuropsychiatric conditions are important for effective PKU management.\\n</td>\n","      <td>Study Title</td>\n","      <td>0_11_Study Title</td>\n","      <td>00000_1-s2.0-S1096719217300525-main.txt</td>\n","      <td>{'answer_start': [], 'text': []}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>[49] M.

With limited therapeutic\\\\nalternatives, many adults with PKU are not adherent to dietary treatment\\\\nand their blood Phe exceeds the recommended range. For example, Walter\\\\net al. found that a majority of adolescents and young adults were not ad-\\\\nherent with recommendations for the monitoring and control of blood\\\\nPhe [11] and, in a recent survey, Brown et al. reported that more than\\\\nhalf (51.7%) of respondents were having difﬁculty managing their PKU, in-\\\\ncluding the maintenance of a Phe-restricted diet [12]. In addition, Berry et\\\\nal. estimated that 71% of adults with PKU in the US between the ages of 19\\\\nand 45 years, who were diagnosed by newborn screen, are not actively\\\\ntreated by a metabolic clinic [13]. This lack of clinical follow-up is pre-\\\\nsumed to be an interaction of multiple factors and may, in part, reﬂect\\\\nthe impact of the continuing evolution of treatment practices and guide-\\\\nlines since the initiation of newborn screening. Difﬁculties accessing meta-\\\\nbolic centers and/or lack of insurance coverage also likely contribute to the\\\\nnonadherence of treatment recommendations. The National PKU Alliance,\\\\na patient and caregiver organization focused on supporting the manage-\\\\nment of PKU, may help to improve lifelong care of these individuals [12].\\\\nHigh blood Phe leads to both acute and chronic neuropsychiatric\\\\nin psychiatric, behavioral, and\\\\nsymptoms\\\\nneurocognitive function often reﬂect the timing, duration, and intensity\\\\nof Phe exposure in addition to the emotional burden of having a chronic\\\\ndisorder [14–19]. Because newborn screening was not implemented be-\\\\nfore the early-to-mid 1960′s, majority of adults with PKU N 55 years of\\\\nage reﬂect ‘late diagnosed’ individuals who did not have the opportuni-\\\\nty for early diagnosis. In addition, because treatment targets have tight-\\\\nened over the proceeding decades, younger aged cohorts (e.g.,\\\\nindividuals with PKU b 40 years of age) would more likely be expected\\\\nto have maintained treatment for life, had increased opportunity for\\\\ncontinuous treatment, and, subsequently, may have less comorbidity\\\\ncompared to older cohorts (e.g., individuals with PKU ≥ 40 years old).\\\\nIndeed, studies published in the last 15 years of individuals with PKU,\\\\nwho were clinically managed from birth, have demonstrated intellectu-\\\\nal abilities predominantly in the normal range [20–21]. However, even\\\\nwith continuous clinical management, neuropsychological, psychoso-\\\\ncial, academic, and/or neuropsychiatric impairments have been ob-\\\\nserved in clinically treated cohorts [22–24].\\\\n', 'Maintaining a Phe-restricted diet that ensures blood Phe levels within\\\\nrecommended guidelines represents a signiﬁcant burden on quality of life,\\\\nand adherence is a major medical problem [10].
